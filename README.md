# Morning & Evening (React Native)
![me_demo_small](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6747473b-6dae-4adb-8d66-53d7b2c16546)

This app is one I have made with other tech stacks, but this version is my favorite. It's not in the app store currently since I don't have Apple Developer account set up yet, but you can download this project and run it in Expo Go.

## Features
- About section for those unfamiliar with the author
- Set reminders for morning and evening readings
- Share app with friends
- Easy bug reporting
